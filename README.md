.bashrc
=======

Nice to keep a comfy little environment always within reach on new systems!

Motivated by the wonderful dotfiles project (http://dotfiles.github.io/), I decided to start sharing my various dotfiles (at this point just bash and vim).  This is my .bashrc file, obviously, which at present really just contains a few helpful aliases.  I will always design this code with an eye towards greatest compatability, especially between MacOS X, Debian, and CentOS.
